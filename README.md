# TCS-Xplore-Hands-On
These are the solution codes to the Hands on Modules of TCS XPLORE Program.

💔 Why I Am Publishing All This

I am uploading all these codes directly from my own account, because TCS still has not sent me the joining letter.
It has been more than half a year, and honestly… my patience is finished now.

I worked so hard on all this.
I kept waiting.
I kept hoping.
But half of 2025 I have been sitting unemployed, only because I was scared that if I join another job, TCS will remove me later.

Now I don’t even trust them anymore.
And even if they finally send the joining letter, I will probably reject it.
Too much time, too much effort, and too many resources are already wasted.

So at least… if my work can help someone else, that will make me feel a little better.

That’s why I am sharing all scripts, code files, and YouTube links openly.
Please check everything properly, and make sure to read the README files inside the ZIP as well.
